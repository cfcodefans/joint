# joint
I have some ideas so I want to put them together to make "joints" between many aspects of programming, for greater values.

note: Sorry for lousy description, more details are in joints-tests project and this is still far from complete. 
I will continue to work on it, try using it in other projects. The final goal is someting useful.

Please check these links for more details:
